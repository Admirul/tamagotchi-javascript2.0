This is my first Tamagotchi javascript project. I will be using this to improve and evalute my Javascript testing ability.
I will attempt to do the following:
The testing of features in a Node project
Create unit tests to specify a function's anticipated behaviour
Utilise a stack trace for debugging
Export objects from files using the "module.exports" function
Use "require" to demand exported values
Create a constructor function
